anything.el has been renamed to Emacs Helm. The new project is hosted under
GitHub? - https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/Emacs-helm. Please, update old
anything.el plugins accordingly to be used with Helm.
so I will rename anything-etag-plus to helm-etag-plus,and new repos
will be https://github.com/jixiuf/helm-etag-plus
