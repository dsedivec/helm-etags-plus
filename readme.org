* helm-etags+.el
  This package use `helm' as an interface to find tag with Etags.
  it support multiple tag files.

  (setq tags-table-list '("/path/of/TAGS1"    "/path/of/TAG2"))

  and it can search parent directory recursively for a file named
  'TAGS'. so you needn't add this special file to `tags-table-list'

* ctags-update.el
    (auto) update TAGS using exuberant-ctags

* anything and helm
anything.el has been renamed to helm.el .

  - https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm.

so I renamed anything-etag-plus to helm-etag-plus,and new repos
will be https://github.com/jixiuf/helm-etag-plus
