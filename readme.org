anything.el has been renamed to helm.el . The new project is hosted under
GitHub? - https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm.
so I will rename anything-etag-plus to helm-etag-plus,and new repos
will be https://github.com/jixiuf/helm-etag-plus

This package use `helm' as a interface to find tag with Etags.

it support multiple tag files.
    (setq tags-table-list '("/path/of/TAGS1"    "/path/of/TAG2"))

and it can recursively searches parent directory recursively for a file named
'TAGS'. so you needn't add this special file to `tags-table-list'
